# DMX configurations

The different folders in this directory contain compatible `settings.h`
headers and `dmx.json` files.

Include the `settings.h` header in the main sketch and upload the
`dmx.json` file to the `config` directory on your OP-Z.

If you want to create a new configuration, just create a new folder with
a title that describes your setup and create a compatible `settings.h`
header and `dmx.json` file.
